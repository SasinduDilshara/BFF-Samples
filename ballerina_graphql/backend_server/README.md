## Ballerina with GraphQL features

Web and mobile apps act as the interface for vast amounts of consolidated data, often requiring users to perform complex queries. With Ballerina's built-in GraphQL functionality, backend developers can simply expose Ballerina records via GraphQL services, facilitating advanced querying and targeted data fetching. This avoids over-fetching and under-fetching of data and reduces the number of network calls, resulting in better response times and lesser resource usage.

### Set up

1. Clone the project 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SasinduDilshara/BFF-Samples.git

3. Then open a new terminal in the project path and run the React server
